Bubble shooter

Game differs from typical bubble shooter in PlayMarket

Game is 2d with first player perspective
Here, instead of static bubbles we have real soap bubbles that moved from bottom of screen (or maybe jar) to the upper boundary
We need to "shoot" them in different ways (need to think about it)
We can shoot them by touching, or by some weapons with projectiles
Each level have progress, different bubbles speed and so on. 
Player has restricted amount of lives, lives decreased at moment when bubble reached upper corner of screen
